# Extreme and Uncontrollable County Lookup

The automatic extreme and uncontrollable circumstances (EUC) policy identifies counties affected by natural disasters and public health emergencies.
A fact sheet that summarizes policy and CMS designated counties for each performance year is available for download via [QPP resource library](https://qpp.cms.gov/resources/resource-library).
There are a few downstream data processing systems within Quality Payment Program (QPP) that require county data enriched with zip codes. 
This repository publishes the county-zipcode crosswalk data in various machine-readable formats and the backoffice programs that generate them.
Refer [Developer Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for more information.
